/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Bio/Entrez/Parser.py:525: UserWarning: Unable to load DTD file esearch.dtd.

Bio.Entrez uses NCBI's DTD files to parse XML files returned by NCBI Entrez.
Though most of NCBI's DTD files are included in the Biopython distribution,
sometimes you may find that a particular DTD file is missing. While we can
access the DTD file through the internet, the parser is much faster if the
required DTD files are available locally.

For this purpose, please download esearch.dtd from

http://eutils.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/eutils/dtd/20060628/esearch.dtd

and save it either in directory

/usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/Bio/Entrez/DTDs

or in directory

/home/rjgreen/.biopython/Bio/Entrez/DTDs

in order for Bio.Entrez to find it.

Alternatively, you can save esearch.dtd in the directory
Bio/Entrez/DTDs in the Biopython distribution, and reinstall Biopython.

Please also inform the Biopython developers about this missing DTD, by
reporting a bug on https://github.com/biopython/biopython/issues or sign
up to our mailing list and emailing us, so that we can include it with the
next release of Biopython.

Proceeding to access the DTD file through the internet...
